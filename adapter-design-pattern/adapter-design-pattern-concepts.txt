adapter pattern is used when there are two incompatible interfaces
for example
In old collections it used enumeration to iterate and delete
In newer collection it uses Iterator interface
so adapter is used to integrate these 
The basic idea is not to modify existing code but to create new classes and interfaces to mange and integrate

This is similart to common adpater betwen chargers like in USA and india

another example can be lets say there are existing vebdor class wit existing logic and interfaces
now a new vendor comes with new interfaces so instead of modifying old code
we can create adapter class that takes input as target and redirect to adpatee

adaptee is the old interface
adapter is the converter
target is the new vendor
client calls the target interface
