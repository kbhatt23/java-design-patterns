why to use:
a. scnenarios when the class hae huge amount of instance variables mainly composition (has a with child beeing dependent on main class)
 
we cna solve above by creating constructirs with so many list but client have to put null for things he do not need
b. Also in case there are a lot of things that are flexible, some cliet uses it some do  not eg: java api classses like Stream , flux etc
c. when we want o hide actual impleentation like Strinbuilder in that case we keep on adding things in builder and only once string is created

d. when we can show clinet to create object in parts step by step.
This is widely used in spring

Not to use scenarios:
when we want to modify the objects even after creating using build method
once object is created we shud not modify the object instances
