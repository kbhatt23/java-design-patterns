chain of responsiblkity meant to pass the same request object to multiple objects(of multiple classes)
When to use:
a. when we want to decouple clietn and api provider like facade show easy things to client hiding complexity
b. when same request of clinet need to be handled by multiple classes(we need multiple classes to add single responsibility priniciple)

Eg:
IT support team , an empoiyee create a ticket and it passes on to main object then that passes to next object and so on.
it gives error if none of the object gets to handle it.

OOB JDK : try catch patter catch is chain handler for same exception object passes form top to down
