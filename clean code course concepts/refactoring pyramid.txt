- Refactoring means editing existing code to make it cleaner
  it is a continuous process and can not be done in single attempt completely
  
- Basically meaning of refactoring means restructuring the code in such a way that 
  it is easier to read, easier to reuse and enhance and hence cheaper in extension and maintainance
  plus the existing functionalities should not break
  business thinks why to waste time in this and not just do new feature development
  but after some time tech debt is so much that new enhancement development takes extremely huge time

hence we should balance b/w tech dept and new functionality development which business does not understand
