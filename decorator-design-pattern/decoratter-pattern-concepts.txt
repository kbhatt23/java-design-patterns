Decoarator patterns are used in case there could be huge amount of sublcasses for numerous cases
Similar to bridge patter
however bridge pattern is meant for newer impleentaion only and decoartor ensures that even for older code structure it works
In bridge pattern if existing code structure is buiilt we can not use as it will enforce to modify existing code and it may break contract
in decorator we can create new classes on top of existing and we can reduce subclasses
Adapter is alsoi meant to solve issue with existing code structure without modifying old code contract
