Facade pattern is used when a subsytem is having complerx interfaces
These lot of interfaces interact with each other to retunr output to client
Facade means a forn end that we show to client
However we can have complex subsytem interfaces interacting and doing logic.
We are basically hiding these complexities to client

Points:
a. We can create a class with a unified objcet input
Instead of client calling subsystem different method and providing indepednet objects
We can pass a unified NEw class with all the data like we have done in My verizon
All the Apis have same request hence having unified object for facade

b. We can still use the complex subsystem method instead of facade as facadae is usut a new class
and we do not modify existing subsystem classes and interfaces
Advantages
Loose coupling
Ease of use
Unified ojects
However client have option to use facade or direct subsystem classes

This is easiest to implement as we just need to create one class with unified object and methods
These simle methods will call set of methods from subsytem whihc take inout as its individual objects

Steps:
Create a new class 
Create methods that contain unified objects all combined to a single class
Take parts of input arguments from facade and pass to individual methods of subsystem
