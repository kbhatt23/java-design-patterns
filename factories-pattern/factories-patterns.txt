Reason of factory usage:
a constuctor can not provide constructor with same data type but with different variable names:
eg:  Rectangle(int length)
	Rectange(int width) : same data type will block


A normal inner class can not have a static function inside it.
Only static inner class can have static method. Also static inner class can be accessed
without the access of outer class
