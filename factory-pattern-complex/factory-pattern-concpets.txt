it is a creational pattern
inside creational it is aprt of class type asit is based on inheritance

factory patterns is used when client do not know whihc subclass of one interface is needed
so it lets a creator interface to decide that and creae instance of it.

benefit : client do not need to focus on how to create object
less chances of bugs
if in future changes neede on how to create object of subclasses it can be done in one place
allows flexibility of programming to interface

Lot of frameworks uses it as they work on very abstract level, and uses inheritance
useful when client should be hidden by what type of subclass is needed

OOB clases that uses factory pattern:
Caendar . getInstance
Strem.of
DateFormatter.getInstance
