Flyweigth pattern is used in case when there are lots of object getting created
Also all these objects behaves nonethless the same
eg: Games liks GTa have players
Games like shootung all the terrorist or anti terrorist are simoliar apart from beeing terrorist or antiterroist

Also so many objhects are need not to be create, we can share the same object among
the various robots with shareable as well as non shareable properties

Intrinsic Properties: These properties are the things that are sharead among objects
MEaning these will remain same for all objects. So these things should be made immutable

Extrinsic properties : These properties are the things whihc will be different for different objects
Thes thing should not be immutable,
Extrinisic properties are kept in Flyweigth Interface
These properties should be immutable as it will be same for all

PArts of patters:
a. Flywweight interface: will have methods of functionaltyes and also setter for extrinsic properties
instincisc properties are common and need not to be put here
b. Concrete classe sshould have intrinsic proeprties
C. Factory class that returns super type
d. Cache/memoty in hashmap for each objects
With the help of above we will make only one object and share across all
