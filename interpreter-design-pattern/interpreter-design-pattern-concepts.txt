This isused when we need to evaluate some expression based on grammar
It is simliar to interpretion
java code gets converted by compiler using javac command to byte code whihc JVM understarts

This is mostly used in PAttern package and expression package

This pattern let the client do the parsing
Based on grammer we can set rules and pass the context(xontext is the utility class having rela logic)
parsing need to be taken care by client

This can be only used when grammar is not very complex
Otherise log of classes and functiolaties woill be created

Interpreter uses command pattern semi structure

REciver is like expression context
And for each method in expression context we are creating a different instance of Expression

So expresison context plays simliar role as Reciever(utility method)
Expression interface is similar to Command interface
We need to create each class for each methoid of expression utility class that implements Expression
