prototype design favours cloning over constructor call
infact in cloning there is no constructor cann and still a new object with a copy of main object is done

When to use:
when creating a object is a big things, lets create a proptype and clone that to resuse and modify according to needs

disadvantages of clonming
Only shallow copy to one level is done in new cloned object
So in overriden clone mehtod we must call clone of instanct cariable whih is of class type
Can be widely used in cacheing frameworks
