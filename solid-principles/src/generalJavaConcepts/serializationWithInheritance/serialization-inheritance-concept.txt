In case su[per is serializable and child auto will be serilizable 
and all the proeprties of child and partent will be present on deserializing

in case super is serializble and u want to block serializtion of child
override readObject and writeObject and throw exception

In case super class is not serializable but child is then in super we need a no arg constructor
which will be used while deserializing as value of super is not called
so since value is not present in serialized file, it calls no arg constructor of super class
if not present will give exception
we can set proeprty values to default here to show up in deserilized
