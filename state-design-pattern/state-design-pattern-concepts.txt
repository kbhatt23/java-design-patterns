State design patterns is usedful when class behaves differently based on state of inbstance variable
What it means is based on one or more values of instance variable(state of class)
if methods(behaviours) work differenlty then we can used this pattern

Instead of having a huge monolith of if and else cases chceking condition based on instance variable
we can have serperate class handling this
each condition can go to concrete impletmentation of State interace

advanatages:
a. more extenisble code
b. easy to find bugs
c. more flexibility in adding another state condition wothout breaking existing code
d. no need to do unit testing of main context class whihc has these state concrete classes

steps :
a. in the same class whihc is already present, modify the existing string state instance variable and make it interface instance
b. make concrete implementations of the instance and for each if conditions create seperate concrete classes
c. decouple and pass the appropriate interface from client
