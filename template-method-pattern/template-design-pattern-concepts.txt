template as the name suggest this pattern provides a rough sketch of algo
meaning a method whihc just provide steps of things
however these primitive individual steps works only when kept in specific order
and these steps can be implemented by child classes
however indicidual steps can still either be overrideen(hook methods) or force to impleement(abstract methods)

Template method pattern is sused when we are aware of the sequence of steps in an algorithm
however the concrete impleteation of each of these setpe might change
but sequence of step is same always

for exampple building a house have fixed step however each step might have some common things, or might have abstract contenet
each subclass can override or implemente these steps (methods) on their logic

this is widely used in frameworks
like each steps of methods call is handled by OOB class whihc is abstract class
We can override whatever methods
Also abstract methods are forced to e implemented by us

General way of implementation
Sequence of methods are defined in abstract class
Abstract class will have one mthord whihc is non abstract -> It has sequence of methods(abstract) and non abstract methods
Hooks : The methods whihc are implemented by super abstract calss but we can override to add our feature in child classes

pattern have below components
a. abstract class
having below methods
- templatemethod: defined the sequence of methods to be called in proper order, this method shoul be final so taht child class do not override it > Cleitn will use this method only
other methods should not be open for client. so we can make them protected so that child class can inherit them and override or implement but client in different package can not access it

- concrete methods -> proper methods with functionalities. can be utility method for child classes-> code reusability benefit
- hooks -> methoids that are non abstract but are kept for child class to be overriden . eg sort method if user want to sort they can override the hook
hooks are commonly used in frameworks like spring 
-abstract methods: methods which can be implemented only by child classes
