visitor pattern is used in case of an operation on each element of a collection or a data structure

suppose list or set of A class exist, if we want to call a method on each of these based on instance of condition
it is not flexibile enough for future
we will have to modify the existing code in existing class
we can use visitor pattern to sperate this logic out to different class
client will need to provide the actual concrete implementation of viitor it want to use

our main aim is not to put complex logic in a method of each iteration element 
as any change will make it editable in future
